Reproducing Unexpected Play / Pause behavior with AVAudioPlayerNode
==========================

This project is a (very) rough and simple showcase of the undesirable play / pause behavior 
when dealing with the AVAudioPlayerNode within the new AVAudioEngine framework of iOS 8.0.
I created this to share with others hoping to find out whether:

1. I'm being an idiot and just don't know how to use AVAudioPlayerNode correctly. Or
2. There is a bug in this framework that I need to open a radar for.
